# azure-servicebus-cli

## Setting the Stage

Create ServiceBus Namespace  
```
scalesets
```

Create queue (DONâ€™T enable Sessions) 
```
w10rs5pr0
```
  Set the lock time to be 5 minutes (MAX)  
  Store the SAS Policy Keys in KeyVault
```
RootManageSharedAccessKey
  Primary Key: **REDACTED**  
  Secondary Key: **REDACTED**  
  Primary Connection String: **REDACTED**  
  Secondary Connection String: **REDACTED**  
```
When you automate generating a SAS token you can pull the ```Primary-Key``` from keyvault.  

## This is a managed identity CLI
Make sure your identity has access to the service-bus in question.  
```
az login
```
## queue settings  

The ```service-bus-settings``` command stores the queue information locally so that we don't all subsequent commands work on that setting.  
```
ServiceBusCLI service-bus-settings -n scalesets -q w10rs5pr0
```
## SecurityAccessSignature Settings  
Next we want to store locally the credentials we need to generate a SAS token using the ```generate-sas``` command.  
```
  generate-sas -k <primary-key> -p RootManageSharedAccessKey -e 3600 -s
```
This is needed so a downstream command ```renew-lock``` can work.  

## Send A Job Message 
```
send-job
```
This is hard coded to send a job json to the service-bus.  

## Receive a Job
```
receive
```

You will notice the following;  
```"MessageId": "100172c6b7b94370bae1ae29399b2631"```  
and  
```"LockToken": "d5d57f8d-ca3b-45fb-9f49-ec5a3d272a6f"```  
## Renew-Lock
```
ServiceBusCLI renew-lock -m 100172c6b7b94370bae1ae29399b2631 -l d5d57f8d-ca3b-45fb-9f49-ec5a3d272a6f
```
This will slide out the lock by whatever you configured the lock-timeout to be.   In my case 5 minutes.  
This demonstrates that a lock can be renewed by anyone as long as you have the credentials to do so.
